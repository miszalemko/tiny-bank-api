Please implement Java service for adding new customers and opening accounts for existing ones. You do not have to implement persistence or web layers. Some base code is available here: https://github.com/pkalamucki/tiny-bank-api. Please fork it and send back the link to your fork when the solution is complete.

Bonus points for:

* Implementing RESTful interface

* Implementing persistence using in-memory database (i.e. H2)

* Using Spring Framework/JEE
